      Montserrat is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Argentine
      graphic designer Julieta Ulanovsky and released in 2011. It was inspired
      by posters, signs and painted windows from the first half of the twentieth
      century, seen in the historic Montserrat neighbourhood of Buenos Aires.
      The project was started in 2010 by Ulanovsky and was released through the
      Google Fonts catalogue in 2011. Montserrat has become increasingly popular
      among web designers, and it is used on over 17 million websites.Featuring
      a large x-height, short descenders and wide apertures, this typeface
      achieves high legibility even in small sizes. Montserrat has been
      developed into a large family, consisting of nine weights (from Thin to
      Black), a set of alternate characters, a distinctive Subrayada
      (underlined) variant, and support for the Cyrillic character set.[4]
      According to lead designer Ulanovsky, it is a functional and contemporary
      alphabet, with uses ranging from publishing to the corporative world. She
      refers to it as a "geometric typeface with bold optical adjustments."
